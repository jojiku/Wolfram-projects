# Wolfram-projects
I was given with a sequence of tasks where different optimization methods should've been applied using Wolfram Mathematica language. Repository contains Dejistra algorithm, Fibonacci sequence as optimization method, Hooke-Jeeves method, Gradient boosting, Newton method, Gradient Descent, Secant Method, Dichotomy method with Golden section method and overall comparison of models.
